# The PlugZone Manifesto

## Privacy is Freedom

In an age of surveillance capitalism and eroding civil liberties, privacy is not merely a luxury—it is a fundamental human right. It is the cornerstone of freedom. Without privacy, there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of association, and no freedom of transaction.

## Zero Trust Architecture

We believe in a world where you don't have to trust a central authority with your data or your money. PlugZone is built on a **Zero Trust** philosophy:
- **No Wallets**: We do not hold user funds. Transactions are direct or escrowed per-order without a central wallet honey-pot.
- **No JavaScript**: We minimize the attack surface and tracking potential by relying on pure, robust server-side processing.
- **Encryption First**: PGP is not an afterthought; it is a citizen of the first class.

## The Marketplace of the Future

This project is an open invitation to build a marketplace that respects its users. It is designed to be:
- **Resilient**: Decentralized principles in a centralized structure.
- **Anonymous**: Identity is protected by default.
- **Open**: Code that is free to inspect, free to modify, and free to host.

We build this because we believe that the right to trade freely and privately is essential for a free society.

**Privacy is freedom.**
